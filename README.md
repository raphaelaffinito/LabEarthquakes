Penn State Rock Mechanics Laboratroy

The purpose of the script is to extract the mechanical data from lab instabilties. 

The script uses a moving window to find the stiffness, slip duration, slip velocty and stress drop for laboratroy earthquakes. 

The script is using fundemental equations from The Mechanics of Earthquakes and Faulting, Third Edition by Christopher H. Scholz

  Currently, the script unfinished.
